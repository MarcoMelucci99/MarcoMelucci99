## 🚀 Welcome to my Cyber Chronicles 🚀 


👋 Hey there! I'm a cybersecurity student at Cyber HackAdemy Unina, passionate about exploring the unseen layers of the digital world. This repository is my personal playground—where code meets security, and curiosity fuels innovation


💻 From dissecting vulnerabilities to crafting defenses, every project here is a step deeper into the art of cybersecurity. Some things are tools, some are experiments... and some? Well, you'll have to see for yourself.


"It's not who I am underneath, but what I do that defines me."🦇
